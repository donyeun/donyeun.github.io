This article is the first out of four posts of the _Machine Learning in Talent Hiring_ series. In this first blog post, we will discuss a little bit about what motivates the implementation of machine learning applications in the hiring process. The [second post](https://donyeun.github.io/2020/05/31/examples-of-machine-learning-projects-in-recruitment-process.html) will discuss several machine learning applications that can potentially be incorporated within the field of recruitment. The [third post](https://donyeun.github.io/2020/05/31/ethical-aspects-of-machine-learning-applications-in-talent-hiring.html) in the series will talk about several caveats and ethical aspects of applying machine learning techniques in the process of talent recruitment. Lastly, the [fourth post](https://donyeun.github.io/2020/05/31/summary.html) will summarise all the prior posts about incorporating machine learning in the recruitment funnel.

As the data are captured every second, along with increased computing power, there have been many applications of machine learning being implemented in real-life. Some of the key points of those applications revolve around minimising human labour through automation, so human involvement can be focused only on the subtasks that needed it the most.

In the context of the business sector, it becomes a second nature that as a company grows, the demand for new employees will also increase. This creates a challenge in the human resource department itself: how to make sure that the hiring team continues to meet the demands of new employees their company has while maintaining the scalability as well as not overburdening the load of the hiring team. One possible solution to these questions is to incorporate machine learning into the talent recruitment pipeline.

## What machine learning can offer?
What can potentially be reshaped with machine learning? Below are some of the potential benefits of implementing machine learning into talent hiring process:

1. Helping to achieve KPIs

   Just like any other jobs, the recruiters typically would have its own key performance indicator (KPI) metrics to quantify the quality of their efforts and outputs. Some common KPIs for the recruiters, for instance, are _time to hire_, _application completion rate_, and _applicants per hire_ (Google Hire Team, 2019). 

   Several machine learning tasks can be implemented to help the hiring team in achieving these KPIs. Time to hire as one of the KPIs of the recruitment team, for instance, can be minimised by conducting a video job interview with an auto-summary or even automatic verdict. Instead of waiting for time availability of the hiring team, the technical interviewers, and the candidates which can lengthen the hiring process for no good reason, we can rely on the automatic video summarisation instead. The system can potentially be able to detect candidates fit to the culture of the company, based on the previous examples of employees’ histories within the company.

2. To better scale the company.

   As the company grows, the hiring volume will also grow. We can ease the burden of the hiring team by helping them, particularly in some of their tasks that are mundane and repetitive. For instance, reading and screening resumes can be automated and will involve little to no human involvement by using natural language processing tasks.

3. To give more time flexibility to the candidates

   By conducting an automatic video job interview, we let the candidates do the interview in the time that suits best to them, and not necessarily only in working hours. This can potentially make sure that the candidate can perform the best they have. By enabling data-driven strategy to the hiring workflow, we can understand the typical attributions of an employee’s performance and can potentially predict the culture fitness of a candidate based on the current employees’ traits within the company.

4. To save operation cost of human resource department.

   As the company grows, the demand for new employees will increase. We can make the demand for human resource department over capacity by implementing machine learning into the recruitment pipeline, making the involvement of human in the process only to the critical and necessary parts. Machine learning can streamline some frequently performed hiring tasks to reduce time-consuming tasks, and ultimately focusing the human resources to more exciting tasks.

## The conventional hiring process
Before we continue, let us talk about what is suboptimal in the conventional recruitment pipeline, and how can we incorporate potential machine learning tasks within each subsystem.

As described by (Holm, 2012) and a simplified adaptation by (Mujtaba & Mahapatra, 2019), the traditional recruitment process may involve the following processes.
1. Identifying and attracting applicants

   This is the initial phase of the entire recruitment pipeline, where the human resource department gets hiring requests from other departments who needed. The required qualifications for each open position as well as its quantity will be determined in this phase.

   Machine learning can play an important role here by doing things. From the perspective of the job application, job seeking can be daunting. While there may be many opportunities scattered across multiple jobs finding websites such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor, it is a little bit painful to find the job openings that are suitable for a candidate. A candidate may have different needs and specific criteria. An NLP application that can extract information based on custom search parameters given by job applicants may be useful for either the candidate as well as the company who posted the job as the job posting is delivered to the right candidate. Recommender system of any available job openings based on machine learning plays an important role here in order to deliver the right job offers to attract the right candidates. 

   An example that is not necessarily directly related to recruitment pipeline is turnover prediction. This may not necessarily directly relate to recruitment pipeline, but having it means that we can predict the demand of new employees in the near future, creating a proactively seeking employee, which in turn might positively impacting the decreasing time to hire.

2. Processing and screening candidates

   As we compile the potential candidates from the previous step, the next step is crucial, which is to conduct screening towards those applications responding to the job advertisement. According to (Mujtaba & Mahapatra, 2019), this process includes parsing the resume of the candidates to find and quantifying the relevancy to the requirements. There may also be personality assessments and another type of assessments that measure the fitness of the candidates. 

   What is suboptimal in here is that it takes much workforce to conduct an interview, both from the HR department as well as the department who demanded new employees where they potentially have to interview the applications. This can help in several KPIs, such as time to hire. By decreasing this essential metric, not only the company can benefit from fulfilling the human resource demand faster, but the candidates also benefiting from the faster recruitment process. In the context of talent war where a company is competing with other companies to find talents, a faster time-to-hire basically means that the company gets the best talent available.

3. Communication and candidate selection

   In this last step, the applications are being informed about the outcome of the hiring process. Several interviews, whether it be in the form of phone calls or video conferences, can also be conducted to explore more about the candidate and its fitness to the company culture.

The more technical in-depth descriptions of some applications in here will be described in the second post of the blog.


## Examples of the success stories
Catalyte is one example of a company that focuses on enabling artificial intelligence approach to its hiring process. One of their mission is, to quote in verbatim, “…provides new opportunities for sustainable and diverse tech talent…” (Anon, 2020). It was stated in an interview by McKinsey that this company built a methodology that can predict a software engineer candidate’ performance regardless of his/her prior skills or experiences (Cheng, Dohrmann & Law, 2018). Finding talents that do not necessarily have the prior opportunity and perhaps would not be given the opportunity in the hiring process, but this company tackles this challenge. It is worth noting that this company that after finding the candidates, they also perform an intervention by conducting 16-20 weeks training to these candidates, which might also significantly contribute to the success rate of the candidates they picked in the first place.

Unilever uses an AI product developed by HireVue in its recruitment project (Booth, 2019). Other companies also reported using the same product, such as Vodafone, Singapore Airlines, and Intel. In the case of Unilever, this multinational company reported that they could save hundreds of $1m globally and nearly 100,000 hours of recruitment time annually. So human can be more focus towards more exciting topics and decisions as opposed to small repetitive tasks that require much time. This is because the demand for human recruiters can be minimised by the introduction of artificial intelligence applications within their hiring process. The company defines specific parameters that can determine the high chance of a successful candidate such as his/her facial expressions as well as the speech word choice of a job seeker.

## Summary
In this post, we have learned what motivates the application of machine learning as a tool to solve several hiring challenges. We have also talked about the subtasks that can potentially be automated with machine learning. Lastly, several examples of products and companies that have used machine learning within their hiring funnel were also described.
